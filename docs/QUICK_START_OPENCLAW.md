# OpenClaw Integration - Quick Start Guide

## ✨ What's New

Your BLADE-AI chatbot can now **execute actions** based on natural language! No more clicking through menus - just tell the bot what you want to do.

## 🎯 Try These Commands

### 🗑️ Remove Packages

```
You: Remove Facebook
Bot: ⚠️ Found 3 Facebook packages:
     • com.facebook.katana
     • com.facebook.system  
     • com.facebook.services
     
     [Cancel] [Confirm]

You: [Click Confirm]
Bot: ✅ Successfully removed 3 packages!
```

### 🔍 Scan for Bloatware

```
You: Scan my phone for bloatware
Bot: 🔍 Scanning...
     
     Found 15 potential bloatware packages:
     • com.facebook.katana (Caution)
     • com.netflix.mediaclient (Safe)
     • com.spotify.music (Safe)
     ...
```

### 🤖 Analyze Packages

```
You: What is com.facebook.katana?
Bot: 🤖 Analyzing...
     
     Package: com.facebook.katana
     Name: Facebook
     Risk: Caution
     
     Safe to remove: Yes
     Consequences: Facebook app will not work
     Dependencies: None critical
```

### 💾 Backup & Restore

```
You: Create a backup first
Bot: 💾 Creating backup...
     ✅ Backup saved: backup_2026-02-20.json
```

```
You: Restore com.facebook.katana
Bot: ⚠️ Restore com.facebook.katana?
     [Cancel] [Confirm]
```

## 🎨 Natural Language Examples

The chatbot understands many ways to phrase commands:

### Uninstall/Remove
- "Remove Facebook"
- "Uninstall Instagram"
- "Delete com.facebook.katana"
- "Get rid of TikTok"
- "Disable Netflix"

### Scan/Search
- "Scan for bloatware"
- "Show me all packages"
- "What apps are on my phone?"
- "Find bloatware"
- "List system apps"

### Analyze
- "Analyze com.facebook.katana"
- "Tell me about Facebook"
- "What is com.instagram.android?"
- "Is Facebook safe to remove?"
- "Info about Instagram"

### Backup
- "Create a backup"
- "Make a backup first"
- "Save my current packages"

## 🔒 Safety Features

### Automatic Confirmations
All destructive actions show a confirmation dialog:
- Package name(s)
- Number of packages
- Action to be performed
- Cancel/Confirm buttons

### Risk Assessment
Packages are color-coded:
- 🟢 **Safe** - Third-party apps
- 🟡 **Caution** - OEM apps  
- 🟠 **Expert** - System components
- 🔴 **Dangerous** - Critical system files

### No Accidental Deletions
The bot will **never** remove anything without:
1. Showing you what will be removed
2. Asking for confirmation
3. Creating a restore point (if enabled)

## 📱 Using OpenClaw Externally (Optional)

Want to control BLADE-AI from WhatsApp or Telegram?

1. **Install OpenClaw**:
   ```powershell
   iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
   ```

2. **Connect your chat app** (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.)

3. **Use from anywhere**:
   ```
   [WhatsApp]
   You: Remove bloatware from my phone
   Claw: 🔍 Scanning via BLADE-AI...
   Claw: Found 12 packages. Remove all? (yes/no)
   You: yes
   Claw: ✅ Done! Removed 12 apps.
   ```

## 🛠️ How It Works

```
Your Message
    ↓
Command Parser (detects intent)
    ↓
Action Executor (finds packages)
    ↓
Confirmation Dialog (shows details)
    ↓
ADB Operations (executes)
    ↓
Result Message (shows status)
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

1. **Be specific**: "Remove Facebook" works better than "remove stuff"
2. **Use package names**: When in doubt, use the full package name
3. **Ask first**: Use "Analyze" before "Remove"
4. **Backup often**: "Create backup" before major changes
5. **Natural language**: The bot understands conversational commands
